    <p>Unfortunately your FLOW did not pass the quality assurance specification and has been disapproved. This is due to a number of reasons chief of which is non adherence to the rules of the contest and or performance deemed to be below standard. You can submit another FLOW for the same contest if time permits or you can participate in other contest. Keep trying. Do not give up.
